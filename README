This project is a simple Rails app that makes ajax calls that return javascript invoking the Google Visualization API.  It exists to highlight a case in which the AreaChart fails to render in Firefox, even though it does in Safari (and there are no javascript errors, etc).

The test_controller.rb has a remote_function tag that invokes the js_data method.  On this page, there is a div called "replaceme" which is where the graph should show up.  The js_data method returns javascript that fills out a DataTable object and invokes the AreaChart's draw method on the "replaceme" div.  In Safari, a chart shows up as expected.  In Firefox, no errors occur, but the gviz call returns an iframe with an empty body.  Hopefully a wonderful person from the Google Visualization API list can help me understand why.

To get started, clone the repo (and make sure you have Ruby and Ruby on Rails installed). From within the new directory, type

script/server -p 3456

Then in your web browser, go to

http://localhost:3456.

You should see a page with a line of text, then a graph, then another line of text.  Firefox on Mac shows a line of text, a big blank space, and another line of text.
